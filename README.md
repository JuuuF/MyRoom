# JuuuF - mental state: ~concerning~ great!

## W\*F is this place?

If you're new to this place, welcome! It is nice to see you here. However, this was not intendent to happen. But feel free to take a look around, get comfy, maybe grab yourself a cup of tea if you can find one lying around. And please don't mind the mess here. I don't really get a lot of visitors in here and I have not yet had the time to take a closer look at the possibilities this place has to offer.

If you wonder, what this is all about, I am sorry to tell you that I don't really have a plan either. Yet. But I an confident that, eventually, as time passes by, this will all take shape. I just hope that shape does not resemble what's going on in my head. That would be concerning. For the time being, this is just my little playground. Or padded cell. It just depends on the way you look at it. If I had to describe it to a real person, I would probably say something like:

A cozy amount of air ~trapped within~ hugged by a handfull of walls with lots of potential inside. I just haven't yet found a neat way to get it out of there with the tools at hand. Maybe you can help me. Maybe you can get your hands on a drill. A nail file might do the job as well.

Anyways, I get sidetracked again. Wilson told me to keep an eye on that.
